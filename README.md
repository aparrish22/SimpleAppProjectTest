# SimpleAppProjectTest
A working version using simple and small data.

Index calls callerScript.js. This script will use ajax to call php_conn.php to obtain data. The php file will json_encode query results into a new data.json

Then the dataTable from index.php will read the file and display it accordingly with search and sorting options.
